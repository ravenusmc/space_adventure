# SpaceAdventure

This project was generated with [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0-beta.22-1.
This is my second project with Angular 2. Again, it is nothing that complex but will
have some basic components. The project will be focused on having a space theme to
it.

## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive/pipe/service/class`.

## Deploying to Github Pages

Run `ng github-pages:deploy` to deploy to Github Pages.
